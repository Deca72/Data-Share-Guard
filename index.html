    <h1>Privacy Policy for Data Share Guard</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Data Share Guard, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension operates and provides clarity on what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data. This policy applies solely to the use of the Data Share Guard extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Share Guard does not collect, store, or share any personal information or user data.</strong> The extension operates locally within your browser to analyze web pages and detect potential privacy risks related to data collection and sharing practices. All operations happen on the client side, and no data is sent to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>How Data Share Guard Works</h2>
    <p>Data Share Guard analyzes the contents of the webpage you are visiting in real time. It checks for specific privacy-related keywords and patterns to provide you with a risk assessment based on the site’s potential data collection and sharing practices. This process happens entirely within your browser, and no external servers or third parties are involved.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>In order to function properly, Data Share Guard requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: This allows the extension to analyze the content of the currently active webpage.</li>
        <li><strong>storage</strong>: This allows the extension to save user preferences locally within the browser. No data is sent to any external server.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting</strong>: The extension uses scripting to evaluate the content of web pages to assess privacy risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Access and Sharing</h2>
    <p>Data Share Guard does not share any user data with third parties. Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no information available to share.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>While Data Share Guard does not collect or process any user data, we take precautions to ensure that our extension operates securely. The extension code is regularly reviewed and updated to prevent vulnerabilities. Additionally, the extension operates entirely within your browser and does not make outbound requests to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. When we make changes, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how Data Share Guard protects your privacy.</p>
